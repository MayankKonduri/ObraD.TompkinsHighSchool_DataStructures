# DataStructures

Welcome to my **Computer Science Data Structures** GitHub repository! This repository contains a diverse set of data structure implementations, covering topics such as file I/O, generics, inheritance, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and GUI using AWT. Each assignment is organized with details, including scores, submission dates, and due dates. Whether you're a fellow student checking your progress or a developer exploring data structures, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource for all things related to data structures.

### Additional Projects
