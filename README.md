\# Computer Science III: Data Structures

## Summary
Welcome to my Computer Science Data Structures GitHub repository! This repository contains a diverse set of data structure and computer science assignments. Covered topics include file I/O, generics, inheritance, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, GUI programming using AWT, and even networking and threading.

## Folder Descriptions

- **ChatServer**  
  Contains multithreaded networking programs for implementing basic chat server functionality.

- **Connect4Repo**  
  A GUI-based Connect 4 game that includes logic for grid management and win condition checking.

- **GUI-AWT**  
  Projects using Java’s Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to create graphical user interfaces.

- **Generics-Inheritance-Stacks-Queues**  
  Demonstrates the use of Java generics and object-oriented principles to implement stacks and queues.

- **Heaps-PriorityQueues**  
  Implements heap structures and priority queues with use cases in efficient element retrieval.

- **LinkedList-Trees**  
  Contains assignments implementing linked list structures and binary tree algorithms.

- **Pathing**  
  Includes projects related to pathfinding algorithms, involving graph traversal.

- **Sets-Maps**  
  Explores Java’s Set and Map interfaces for managing collections of unique and key-value paired data.

- **Sorts-Searches**  
  Implements various sorting (e.g., merge sort, quicksort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).

- **Threads-Networking**  
  Covers multithreading and basic networking in Java, including server-client communication examples.
